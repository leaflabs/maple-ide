Many libraries still need to be ported from Arduino... grab the original source 
from the Arduino SVN repo and get hacking!

- The LiquidCrystal library has already been ported and lives in this directory

- The Wire library has been partially ported, the current implementation only 
  supports master mode using a bit-banged (software) protocol. Future 
  enhancements will use the hardware i2c peripheral on the stm32 as well as the 
  DMA for performance. Support for slave, smBUS, and multimaster modes are also 
  slated for inclusion in the enhanced Wire port.
