<h1>Maple Reference Documentation: JTAG</h1>
<p>
JTAG is an interface for low-level debugging of digital devices. It gives 
instruction by instruction control over the microprocessor and allows data
to be read and written to arbitrary memory and register locations. It is 
typically used with a debugging tool like gdb when hacking low level routines
and hardware peripherals (we use it when working on libmaple) or to flash
a new bootloader.

<p>
Note that the stm32 on the Maple has a built-in low level serial debugger which
could also be used to flash bootloaders, and that the ASSERT framework allows
basic debugging over a USART serial channel; we expect only advanced users
who already have a JTAG device would want to use this feature.

<h2><a name="wiring">Wiring Diagram</a></h2>
<div class="centerimg">

JTAG wiring diagram to connect a standard 20-pin ARM JTAG device to the 8-pin
JTAG port on the Maple.
</div>
<p>
The Maple has holes for a 8-pin JTAG header but that header is not soldered on
by default. If you know ahead of time that you'll be needing it, and you order
straight from LeafLabs, add a comment to your order and we can probably
solder one on for no charge. Otherwise you can simply attach standard 0.1"
pitch male header pins (either the exact 4x2 block or two 4-pin pieces of 
breakaway straight header). For one-off usage hack the header can be jammed in
the holes and twisted to ensure electrical contact: this is what we do to flash
our bootloader. 

<p>
The following schematic assumes that the header has been soldered on to the
<i>bottom</i> of the board, not the top; most ribbon cable connectors will
interfere with the power header. If you don't want a header comming off the
bottom you can use a slim connector and invert this diagram appropriately.

We have had good experience with the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD device, which costs
about 55 euro plus shipping (<a

If you have success with something else let us know!
