<h1>Maple-Arduino Compatability Notes</h1>

</ul>

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
The biggest difference between the Maple and most Arduino boards is that the
Maple uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 architecture chip while the Arduinos have
8-bit Atmel AVR chips. The different instruction set means that machine code
(executable binary programs) is incompatible between the two and a different
compiler (actually just a different version of gcc) is required. The compiler
for the regular Arduino IDE is the popular "avr-gcc" package; the compiler
for the Maple version of the IDE is Codesourcery's edition of gcc for the
ARM EABI target (aka "arm-non-eabi-gcc"). 

<p>
The bitwidth of the processor means that the Maple can process 32-bit operations
in a single instruction (for instance add two 32-bit integers together) while
an Arduino processor would have to split up large operations into several
smaller ones. In a lot of cases 8-bit operations are plenty (integers 0-255,
single characters of text, etc), but if you're dealing with higher resolution
data the speed up could be significant. A trade-off is that code could be
larger as well; program instructions and memory locations can be up to 32-bits
each as well, which in the worst case would quadruple program size. In reality
the removal of extra instructions and fancy packing together of simple 
instructions means that programs aren't much larger (or are even smaller).


<h2><a name="headers">Header Numbering and Incompatabilities</a></h2>

The numbering of headers is different; on the Maple each GPIO has a unique
number: D0, D1, D2, all the way up to D37 (actually there are a couple
more...).  On the Arduino the analog pins are numbered seperately (A0-A5) from
the digital pins (D0-D13). 

<p>
The incompatible hardware differences are:
<ul>

  <li><b>i2c port:</b> on most Arduinos the i2c port is Analog Input 4 (SDA)
  and Analog Input 5 (SCL); on the Maple i2c port 1 is D5 (SCL) and D9 (SDA),
  and i2c port 2 is D29 (SCL) and D30 (SDA). It should be possible to skywire,
  sacraficing signal quality (increased capacitance). Or i2c can be bit
  banged reasonably well in software. Or this peripheral could potentially
  be rerouted internally (but we haven't looked in to it).

  <li><b>PWM on D10:</b> all the other standard Arduino PWM headers have 
  PWM functionality on the Maple (D2,D3,D6,D9,D11), but not D10. We did our
  best! It may be possible to reroute this peripheral internally using low
  level configuration (but we haven't looked in to it). 

  <li><b>EEPROM:</b> the Maple does not have any internal EEPROM. This 
  functionality can be emulated with regular peristant flash memory, or with
  an external EEPROM chip. 

  <li><b>ISP Programming:</b> the Maple does not use an ISP/ICSP bus for 
  debugging; it uses JTAG. 

</ul>

<h2><a name="software">Software Language/Library Changes</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>32-bit int:</b> many standard functions either expect or return full
  32-bit (4 byte) integer values instead of the regular 16-bit (2 byte)Arduino
  values.

  <li><b>pinMode types:</b> any GPIO (including analog pins) can be configured
  into one of the following modes with a single call to pinMode: OUTPUT,
  OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN, INPUT_FLOATING, INPUT_PULLUP, INPUT_PULLDOWN. Additionally
  the PWM and Analog Input pins can be configured as INPUT_ANALOG and PWM 
  respectively. See <a href="gpio.html">GPIO docs</a> for more info.

  <li><b>Serial1 syntax:</b> like the Arduino Mega, the Maple has multiple 
  USART ports. By default <code>Serial</code> is not maped to any of them,
  use <code>Serial1</code> through <code>Serial3</code> instead.

  <li><b>16-bit PWM</b>

  <li><b>12-bit ADC</b>

</ul>
