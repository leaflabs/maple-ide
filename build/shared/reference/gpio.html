<h1>Maple Reference Documentation: GPIO</h1>
<p>
In addition to any special features or peripheral functions, all of the
numbered Maple header pins can function as programmable digital input/output.

<p>
The current and voltage limitations have not been copied over from the stm32
datasheet; see that reference linked at the bottom. In particular a number
of GPIO pins are 5v tolerant (which means that applying 5v to a pin and
reading it as input or allowing it to drain to ground will not damage that
pin), while some are not.

<h2><a name="modes">GPIO Modes</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt>OUTPUT
  <dd>Basic digital output: when the pin set high the voltage is held at +3.3v
  (Vcc) and when set low it is pulled down to ground.
    
  <dt>OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN
  <dd>In open drain mode, the pin indicates "low" by accepting current flow to
  ground and "high" by providing increased impedence. An example use would be
  to connect a pin to a bus line (which is pulled up to a positive voltage by a
  seperate supply through a large resistor). When the pin is high, not much
  current flows through to ground and the line stays at positive voltage; when
  the pin is low the bus "drains" to ground with a small amount of current
  constantly flowing through the large resistor from the external supply. In
  this mode no current is ever actually /sourced/ from the pin. 

  <dt>INPUT (or INPUT_FLOATING)
  <dd>Basic digital input. The pin voltage is sampled; when it is closer to
  3.3v (Vcc) the pin status is high, and when it is closer to 0v (ground) it is
  low. If no external circuit is pulling the pin voltage to high or low, it
  will tend to randomly oscillate and be very sensitive to noise (eg a breath
  of air across the pin will cause the state to flip).

  <dt>INPUT_PULLUP
  <dd>The state of the pin in this mode is reported the same way as with INPUT,
  but the pin voltage is gently "pulled up" towards +3.3v. This means the state
  will be high unless an external device is specifically pulling the pin down
  to ground, in which case the "gentle" pull up will not effect the state of
  the input.

  <dt>INPUT_PULLDOWN
  <dd>The state of the pin in this mode is reported the same way as with INPUT,
  but the pin voltage is gently "pulled down " towards 0v. This means the state
  will be low unless an external device is specifically pulling the pin up to
  3.3v, in which case the "gentle" pull down will not effect the state of the
  input.

  <dt>INPUT_ANALOG
  <dd>This is a special mode for when the pin will be used for analog (not
  digital) reads. See the <a href="adc.html">ADC</a> page.

  <dt>PWM
  <dd>This is a special mode for when the pin will be used for PWM output (a
  special case of digital output). See the <a href="pwm.html">PWM</a> page.
</dl>

<h2><a name="functions">Funtion Reference</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><code>pinMode(pin_number, MODE)</code>
  <dd>Usually called from within <code>setup()</code> to configure the pin.
  <code>MODE</code> is one of the set listed above.

  <dt><code>digitalRead(pin_number)</code>
  <dd>Returns 0 (low) or 1 (high).

  <dt><code>digitalWrite(pin_number, value))</code>
  <dd>Sets the pin to high (1) or low (0).
</dl>
