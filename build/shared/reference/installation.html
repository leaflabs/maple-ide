<h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>
The latest binary release of the Maple IDE for popular platforms can be
downloaded straight from LeafLabs's server using the links below. The package
bundles together a compiler, an upload utility, a software library, and a
simple GUI text editor to tie it all together.

<p>
All this software is <a href="http://fsf.org">free and open</a>, feel free to
redistribute, hack, and generally mess around with it! We're grateful to the
<a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, <a

<h2><a name="java">Java</a></h2>

The IDE is written in Java and requires a compatible runtime (JRE). Our windows
release includes runtime, Mac OSX has one installed already, and it's pretty
easy to install one on Linux. If you already have a JRE setup you can skip to
the next step; <a href="http://sun.com/java">Sun Java 1.6</a> and <a
href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK 1.6</a> are known to work, and
runtimes mostly compatible with Sun Java 1.4+ should probably get the job
done. 

<p>
To install Java on a linux/unix system, try using your distribution's software
packaging tool and search for "JRE" or "java". On modern Debian-based systems
(including Ubuntu) you can try to install the OpenJDK 1.6 JRE with:

<pre class="code">
$ sudo aptitude install openjdk-6-jre
</pre>

<h2><a name="linux">Linux Directions</a></h2>

Once it's downloaded, you need to chose a place to unzip the IDE. Unless
you've got a special place of honor in mind just plop it on your desktop or in
your home folder. Your system should have a tool to deal with the file time of
the archive (gzipped tar files on Linux, .dmg archives on Mac OSX, and classic
.zip files on Windows); make sure you actually extract the contents out of the
archive instead of running it live out of the archive file.

<p>
On Linux the tar tool can be used from the command line a la:
<pre class="code">
$ tar -xvf maple-ide-SOMETHING.tgz
</pre>

<p>
In the long run you might want to move the extracted program around; that's
fine, your programs (sketches) and configuration options will be stored in your
home folder (changeable in the Preferences menu).

<h4>Install udev rules</h4>

As a security precaution, new USB devices like the Maple are accessible only by
the root user on Linux systems. It's thrilling to run around with root
permissions every now and then but in the long run it's safer to configure the
operating system to allow regular users access to the Maple when it's plugged
in.

<p>
Enter the unzipped maple-ide folder and run the install-udev-rules.sh script to
configure the system so that members of the "plugdev" group can access the
maple device automatically; it will ask for root permissions (via "sudo"). Or
you can manually copy the <code>45-maple.rules</code> file into
<code>/etc/udev/rules.d</code> and set the appropriate permissions.

<p>
If this doesn't work out for you (eg, an error gets thrown or later on you
can't upload your program or connect to the serial port), as a temporary or
last resort measure you can run the entire IDE as root (<code>sudo
maple-ide</code>).

<h2><a name="macosx">Mac OS X Directions</a></h2>

Once it's downloaded, you need to chose a place to unzip the IDE. Unless
you've got a special place of honor in mind just plop it on your desktop or in
your home folder. Your system should have a tool to deal with the file time of
the archive (.dmg archives on Mac OSX); once the archive is open, you can
either drag the Maple IDE folder into the link to your Applications folder for
a permanent installation, or drag it to you desktop for now. You'll also need
to install the bundled serial port drivers; double click on that archive and
follow the directions.

In the long run you might want to move the extracted program around; that's
