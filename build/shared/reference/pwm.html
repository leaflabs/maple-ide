<h1>Maple Reference Documentation: PWM</h1>
<p>
Pulse Width Modulatiom is a basic technique to create repeated square waves
(digital high/low voltage transitions) of user defined length and duty cycle.
It can be used as a way to encode an "analog" signal on a single 
digital (high/low) line using the time between transitions ("pulse width") 
as the variable; this technique is commonly used to send servo position 
and motor speed commands. Another use is to use to the ratio of "high" and
"low" time to approximate a voltage output; this technique can be used to
dim an LED or even (with careful filtering) generate audio waveforms.

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
The Maple has a large number of 16-bit PWM outputs, each connected to one of 4
timers. Some configuration, such as the clock rate or prescaling, must be
common to the entire timer; see the <a href="timers.html">timer docs</a> for
more information!
<p>
Note that unlike the Arduino, the Maple does not have PWM functionality on
pin D10; all other pins are <a href="./compatability.html">compatible</a>. 
<p>
The following table shows which <a href="timers.html">timer</a> generates which
PWM outputs. See the <a href="gpio.html#pins">pin mapping table</a> to track
down exactly which timer <i>channel</i> corresponds to each pin.

<table>
  <tr><th>Timer     <th>PWM Headers
  <tr><td>Timer1    <td>D6,D7,D8
  <tr><td>Timer2    <td>D0,D1,D2,D3
  <tr><td>Timer3    <td>D11,D12,D27,D28
  <tr><td>Timer4    <td>D5,D9,D14,D24
</table>

<h2><a name="background">Background</a></h2>
<p>
In it's simplest form the device is a single counter with two variables. The
counter starts at zero and the output starts at "high". The counter increments
every clock cycle until it reaches the first variable number, at which point
the output goes "low". The counter continues incrementing until it reaches the
second variable at which point the output goes "high" again and the counter
resets to zero. The time spent with output high is called the pulse duration or
duty; the total time before repeat is the period.

<p>
This simple functionality could be approximated in software by setting a GPIO
high or low, but the beauty of PWM is that the usercode simply has to configure
the device and set the two variables and the device will function on it's own;
no further microprocessor cycles will be consumed and a repeated HIGH/LOW
waveform will spew out.

<p>
The Maple has 16-bit PWM resolution, which means that the counter and variables
can be as large as 65535, as opposed to 255 with 8-bit resolution. With a 72MHz
clock rate, a PWM output could have maximum period of about one millisecond;
using a prescaler (clock divider) in front of the counter and can increase this
maximum period (eg, an 8x prescaler would result in around an 8ms maximum duty
cycle). The setting the period variable to something other than the maximum 
value gives further control over the total length of the waveform, but 
effectively limits the resolution with which the duty can be modified: the duty
must be lower than or equal to the period.

<p>
Here are some commonly used PWM configurations (note: double check our math!):

<table>
  <tr><th>Purpose<th>Period (ms)<th>Duty (ms)<th>Prescaler<th>Period<th>Duty
  <tr><td>LED Throb
      <td>0.020ms
      <td>0 to 0.020ms
      <td>1 (none)
      <td>65535 (default)
      <td>0 to 767
  <tr><td>Servo Control
      <td>20ms
      <td>1.25 (0deg) <br>1.50ms (90deg) <br>1.75 (180deg)
      <td>21 <br>21 <br>21
      <td>65535 (default) <br>65535 (default) <br>65535 (default)
      <td>4096 <br>4915 <br>5734

<h2><a name="functions">Function Reference</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><code>pinMode(pin_num, PWM)</code>
  <dd>This command is usually called from <code>setup()</code> to tell the
  microcontroller that <code>pin_num</code> should be configured to PWM output.
  PWM implies regular driven OUTPUT (not open drain etc).

  <dt><code>pwmWrite(pin_num, value)</code>
  <dd>This command sets the PWM duty. User code is expected to determine and
  honor the maximum value (based on the configured period). As a convenience,
  <code>analogWrite</code> is an alias of <code>pwmWrite</code> to ease porting
  Arduino code, though period and duty will have to be recalibrated (see
  <a href="./compatability.html">compatability.html</a>).

  <dt><code>Timer1.setPrescaleFactor(prescale)</code>
  <dd>Find the appropriate timer for a given PWM header using the table above,
  then set the prescaler. This function is normally called once from
  <code>setup()</code>, but the timer can be reconfigured with a new prescaler
  at any time. The default prescaler is 1 (eg, no prescaling). 

  <dt><code>Timer1.setOverflow(overflow)</code>
  <dd>This function sets the period ("reload" or "overflow") value for an
  entire PWM timer bank. The value is 16bit (0 to 65535) and determines the
  maximum value that can be written with <code>pwmWrite()</code> corresponding
  to 100% duty cycle.  This also affects the PWM frequency: the higher reload
  is, the lower the PWM frequency will be.
