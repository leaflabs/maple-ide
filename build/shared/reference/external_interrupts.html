<h1>Maple Reference Documentation: External Interrupts</h1>
<p>
External interrupts can be used to trigger routines to run in response
to changes in voltage on a pin. Each GPIO pin on the Maple can be used to detect
transitions such as when the voltage goes from low to high, or from high to low.
This technique can be used to avoid unnecessary polling of the state of a pin.

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
External interrupts are often used to detect when events happen outside of
the microcontroller. These can be used to tell the Maple when events happen,
such as when a sensor has data ready to be read, or when a button has been
pushed. When such an event happens, an interrupt is raised and the Maple
can react to it with a preset <i>interrupt handler</i>.

<p>
Every GPIO pin on the Maple can be used as an external interrupt, subject to
certain constraints; there can be a maximum of 16 different external interrupts
set up at a time on the Maple. This is because the external interrupt lines
on the STM32 are multiplexed between GPIO ports. In effect, this means that
every pin on the Maple maps to a certain EXTI line, and within that EXTI line,
only one of the pins that maps to it can be used as an external interrupt at
a time.
<p>
The following table shows which pins can be used on which lines.
<table>
  <tr><th>EXTI Line<th>Maple pins
  <tr><td>EXTI0<td>2, 15, 27
  <tr><td>EXTI1<td>3, 16, 28
  <tr><td>EXTI2<td>1, 17, 25

<h2><a name="functions">Function Reference</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><code>attachInterrupt(pin, handler, mode)</code>
  <dd>This command attaches the function <code>handler</code> to run
  when a transition of type <code>mode</code> is detected on pin <code>pin</code>.
  <p>
  Mode can be any of the following:
  <dd><strong>RISING:</strong> To trigger the interrupt when the pin goes from low to high.
  <dd><strong>FALLING:</strong> To trigger the interrupt when the pin goes from low to high.
  <dd><strong>CHANGE:</strong> To trigger the interrupt when the pin goes from
      either low to high or high to low.


  <dt><code>detachInterrupt(pin)</code>
  <dd>Turns off the interrupt handler on pin <code>pin</code>.
