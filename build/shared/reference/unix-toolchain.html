<h1>libmaple Unix Toolchain Quickstart</h1>

You'll need a Maple board, a mini-b USB cable, a functional computer,
and possibly root access to that computer.  This guide assumes you've
had success with the IDE on your machine and that you are fairly
comfortable with the Unix command line; some previous experience with
editing your shell startup script (.bashrc, .tcshrc, etc.) and
using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a> is
recommended. For generic installation/setup issues
the <a href="./install.html">install </a>
and <a href="./troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> pages may be
helpful.  If all else fails
try <a href="http://google.com/?q=maple+help">google</a>,

or <a href="http://leaflabs.com/contact">contact us directly</a>!

<p>
We currently have instructions for Linux and OS X Snow Leopard.  If
you're on another Unix platform, Windows, or an earlier version of OS
X, we're guessing that you can translate/port these directions on your
own. As a jumping off point, you can find stripped down distributions
of the CodeSourcery GCC compiler tools (including win32 versions) in
the same download directory as the Linux ones mentioned below.  If
you <i>do</i> have success on other platforms, please post in the
forums so we can fold your tips into this document!

</ul>

<h2><a name="linux">Linux Setup</a></h2> These instructions are
oriented towards Linux users using a contemporary Debian-based
distribution.

<h3>1. Collect and Install Tools</h3>

First I'll give the commands to run, then explain:

<pre class="code">
$ sudo aptitude install build-essential git-core wget screen dfu-util \
                        openocd python python-serial 
</pre>

You'll want to install a bunch of developer "basics" like <code>make</code>,
<code>tar</code>, etc. A good catch-all for these tools is the
"build-essential" meta-package on most debian platforms: installing this fake
package will pull in dozens of useful tools without bogging your system down
too much. <code>git-core</code> is the name of the git package; git is a
distributed code versioning system we use to track changes in our source code.
<code>wget</code> is a simple tool to download files over http from the command
line and is optional (you could pull in the required downloads using a
browser). <code>screen</code> is a really cool virtual terminal program; in the
context of Maple we use it to connect to serial port devices.

<p> <code>dfu-util</code> is a tool from the <a
href="http://openmoko.com">OpenMoko</a> project that we use to upload programs
to the Maple over USB.

<p> <code>openocd</code> is a JTAG control program used in conjunction with an
ARM JTAG device to do in circuit debugging (pause/resume program execution,
upload and download code, read out register status, etc). (optional)

<p> 
Lastly, our reset script (which sends control signals over the USB-serial
connection to restart and enter the bootloader) is written in Python and
requires the PySerial library (the <code>python-serial</code> package; this
could also be installed with easy_install).

<h3>2. Fetch libmaple and Compiler Toolchain</h3>

<pre class="code">
$ cd ~ 
$ git clone git://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple.git libmaple 
$ cd libmaple 
$ wget http://static.leaflabs.com/pub/codesourcery/\
$ arm-2009q3-68-arm-none-eabi-toolchain-linux32.tar.gz tar xvf arm-*.tar.gz
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/libmaple/arm/bin # or wherever these tools ended up 
</pre>

<p> 
Fairly straight forward... do a git clone of the libmaple repository to some
directory, then download and extract the ARM compiler toolchain. 

<p> 
The <code>arm/bin/</code> directory will needs to be added to PATH; you can
check that this worked by entering <code>arm-none-</code> and hitting tab to
auto-complete (bash should show a bunch of results). If you want to move that
toolchain somewhere else and add it in a .bashrc script or whatever make sure
to preserve the directory layout as the binaries will make relative path calls
and references.

<h3><a name="udev">3. Install udev Rules</a></h3> 

<pre class="code">
$ groups # make sure it includes plugdev; if not add yourself to it 
$ sudo cp support/scripts/45-maple.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/45-maple.rules 
$ sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart 
</pre>

<p> 
As a security precaution on linux, unknown USB devices can only be accessed by
the superuser. This udev script identifies the Maple based on it's vendor and
product IDs, mounts it to /dev/maple, and grants read/write permissions to the
<code>plugdev</code> group. After restarting udev you'll need to fully unplug
or power cycle any Maples connected to the computer.

<h3>All done?</h3>
Great! Go ahead and <a href="#test">test everything out</a>.

<h2><a name="osx">OS X Setup</a></h2>

These instructions have been tested successfully on OS X 10.6.4.  As
stated previously, this document assumes a general level of Unix
aptitude on the part of the reader; if you're uncomfortable using
Terminal (or if you don't know what that means), then you should
probably stick with using
the <a href="http://leaflabs.com/docs/maple-ide/">Maple IDE</a> to
develop programs.

Some of these software packages might be available
on <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>.  The author had
some bad experiences with MacPorts a few years ago, though, and hasn't
touched it since.  Of course, your mileage may vary.

<h3>1. Collect and Install Tools</h3>
You will need the following tools to get started:

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html">XCode</a>:
  If you're reading this, you've probably already got this.  Provides
  compilers and other basic tools of the trade.  It's a free download,
  but requires registration (gross, we know).
  <li>Git: All of our code is tracked by a distributed versioning
  system called git.
  A <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/">Mac
  installer</a> is available.
  <li>dfu-util: A tool
  from <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/">OpenMoko</a> that we use to
  upload programs to the Maple over USB.  If you're feeling
  masochistic, there are instructions
  for <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Dfu-util#Mac">building
  dfu-util from source</a>.
    
  <p>
  However, if you've got better things to do, you can steal
  a <code>dfu-util</code> binary from a program
  called <a href="http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=Openmoko%20Flasher">Openmoko
  Flasher</a>.  To do this,
  first <a href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/omflasher/downloads/">download
  Openmoko Flasher</a>, then copy the .app into your Applications
  folder (or wherever you like).  Let's pretend you saved the .app to
  the directory

<pre class="code">/Applications/OpenMoko Flasher.app</pre>

  Then the dfu-util binary resides in

<pre class="code">/Applications/OpenMoko Flasher.app/Contents/Mac OS/dfu-util</pre>

  To get access to it from the command line, just make a symbolic link
  to the binary from some place on your PATH:

<pre class="code">
$ ln -s /Applications/OpenMoko\ Flasher.app/Contents/Mac\ OS/dfu-util \
        /somewhere/on/your/PATH/dfu-util
</pre>

  Note that just copying the binary doesn't work, as it relies on
  dynamically linked libraries found elsewhere in the .app bundle.
  (You can alternatively pull all of the relevant pieces out of the
  .app and save them somewhere, but you're on your own).  To make sure
  this worked, try plugging in your Maple, making sure it's in
  bootloader mode (you can do this by pressing RESET, then quickly
  pressing BUT and holding it for several seconds), then running

<pre class="code">
$ dfu-util -l
</pre>

  If you see some lines that look like

<pre class="code">
Found DFU: [0x1eaf:0x0003] devnum=0, cfg=0, intf=0, alt=0, name="DFU Program RAM 0x20000C00"
Found DFU: [0x1eaf:0x0003] devnum=0, cfg=0, intf=0, alt=1, name="DFU Program FLASH 0x08005000"
</pre>

  then you're all set.

  <li>PySerial: our reset script (which sends control signals over the
  USB-serial connection to restart and enter the bootloader) is
  written in Python and requires
  the <a href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/">PySerial library</a>.
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial">Download the latest
  version</a>.  After you download and untar, install it with

<pre class="code">$ cd /path/to/pyserial-x.y
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>

  The package is also available via <code>easy_install</code>, so if
  you're comfortable using that, you could also install it with

<pre class="code">$ easy_install pyserial</pre>
</ol>

<h3>2. Fetch libmaple and Compiler Toolchain</h3>
You first need to clone libmaple:

<pre class="code">$ cd ~
$ git clone git://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple.git libmaple</pre>

  Then you need to get the cross-compilers we use to build a project.
  These are just modified versions of GCC; you can
  <a href="http://static.leaflabs.com/pub/codesourcery/arm-2010q1-188-arm-none-eabi-toolchain-macosx32.tar.gz">download
  them for OS X here</a>.  Assuming you saved this file
  to <code>~/Downloads/arm-2010q1-188-arm-none-eabi-toolchain-macosx32.tar.gz</code>,
  you can then unpack the archive and let OS X know where the
  compilers live with

<pre class="code">
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ tar -xvzf arm-2010q1-188-arm-none-eabi-toolchain-macosx32.tar.gz
$ mv arm ~/libmaple/arm
</pre>  

  After that's done, you'll probably want to update your shell startup
  script to stick <code>~/libmaple/arm/bin</code> into
  your <code>PATH</code>.

<h3>All done?</h3> 

Great!  Go ahead and <a href="#test">test everything out</a>.

</ol>

<h2><a name="test">Test compilation</a></h2>

Get back into the libmaple directory (this tutorial assumes you put
it in ~/libmaple) and test that you've installed all the
compilation tools correctly:

<pre class="code">$ cd ~/libmaple
$ cp main.cpp.example main.cpp
$ make clean
$ make</pre>

If it all worked out, you should end up seeing something like this at the end:

<pre class="code">
find build -iname *.o | xargs arm-none-eabi-size -t
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    482       4      24     510     1fe build/wirish/comm/HardwareSerial.o
    260       0       0     260     104 build/wirish/comm/HardwareSPI.o
     60       0       0      60      3c build/wirish/wirish.o

[...]

   2196       0       1    2197     895 build/libmaple/usb/usb_lib/usb_core.o
   1904       0       0    1904     770 build/libmaple/usb/usb_lib/usb_regs.o
     56       0       0      56      38 build/libmaple/usb/usb_lib/usb_init.o
    344       0       0     344     158 build/libmaple/usb/usb_hardware.o
   6637       0      58    6695    1a27 build/main.o
  21499     201     391   22091    564b (TOTALS)

Final Size:

  21824     200     552   22576    5830 build/maple.out
Flash build
</pre>

  That's it!  You're all set.  The "dec" field at the end gives the
  total program size in bytes. The long listing of object files above
  the Final Size helps to identify bloated code; as you write larger
  projects, you may find that they use too much space.  If that
  happens, the file-by-file listing will help you track down the
  fatties porking up your program.

<h2><a name="upload">Upload a program</a></h2>

<pre class="code">
$ cd ~/libmaple
$ cp examples/test-session.cpp main.cpp
$ make clean
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
<p>
Ok, let's blow away the little example program and upload the
interactive test session. If you're on Linux, then before
executing <code>make install</code> you'll want to have the udev rules
setup <a href="#udev">as described above</a> and have the Maple
plugged in.

<p>
A number of things can go wrong at this stage; simple debugging steps
include using the perpetual bootloader mode, restarting Maple a couple
times, make-ing clean, etc.  If nothing works,
the <a href="http://forums.leaflabs.com">forum</a> is your friend.

<h2><a name="communicate">Communicate over USB-serial interface</a></h2>

Okay, now that we've flashed the interactive test session to the
Maple, let's test it out.  The device for the maple should look
something like "/dev/ttyACMXXX" on Linux or "/dev/tty.usbmodemXXX" on
OS X, but it might have a slightly different name on your system.  To
open up a session, run

<pre class="code">
$ screen /dev/tty-whatever-it-is
</pre>

If the interactive test program built and uploaded correctly, you
should be able to connect with <code>screen</code>. Type 'h' or hit
the space bar to get a response; there are a number of commands which
demonstrate Maple peripheral features.

As of August 2010, the HardwareSerial library is blocking, so using
any commands which would write to the USART Serial ports will cause
the program to hang.

To exit the screen session, type C-a C-\ (control-a, followed by
control-backslash), and type "y" when prompted if you're sure.

<h2><a name="startingyourown">Starting your own projects</a></h2>

So everything worked, and you want to start your own project?  Great!
It's easy.  Just set the environment
variable <code>LIB_MAPLE_HOME</code> in your shell startup script to
point to the libmaple repository you cloned (this tutorial assumes you
put it in <code>~/libmaple</code>).  For example, if you
use <code>bash</code> as your shell, just put this line in your
<code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.bash_profile</code>:

<pre class="code">
export LIB_MAPLE_HOME=~/libmaple
</pre>

Now, in order to start your own projects, just grab a copy of the
<code>Makefile</code> and skeleton <code>main.cpp</code> we provided
in the libmaple repository, and you're good to go:

<pre class="code">
$ cd
$ mkdir my-awesome-project
$ cp ~/libmaple/Makefile ~/libmaple/build-targets.mk my-awesome-project
$ cp ~/libmaple/main.cpp.example my-awesome-project/main.cpp
</pre>

(TEMPORARY: The file <code>build-targets.mk</code> is where the rule
to build the object file for <code>main.cpp</code> lives. If you have
multiple source files, you'll probably need to look at it and edit as
appropriate.  We're sorry about that and will update the Makefile
structure later to remove this pain point.)

Then hack away!  You can <code>make</code>, <code>make clean</code>,
and <code>make install</code> from your new
directory <code>my-awesome-project</code> just like you did in the
libmaple repository.

<h2><a name="openocd">Debug with OpenOCD</a></h2>

TODO. For now see <a href="http://fun-tech.se/stm32/OpenOCD/index.php">this
great guide</a> from fun-tech.se. 


<h2><a name="codeblocks">Do it all with Code::Blocks</a></h2>

Optional.  Code::Blocks is a generic cross platform IDE. We don't
personally use it for development so we haven't worked out all the
kinks (eg, debugging isn't integrated), but it might be helpful for
people who are allergic to <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>
and/or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.

The simple configuration described here just calls down to the Makefile, so
follow the above directions to get the command line tools configured (you'll
definitely need the arm-none-eabi-* tools on your path by default), then
<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26">install
Code::Blocks</a>.  You can do this on Linux with:

<pre class="code">
$ sudo aptitude install codeblocks 
</pre>

The first time it runs you'll maybe want to disable all the glitzy "Getting
Started" crap (when will they learn?). We've added a .cbp "projects" file to
the libmaple repository: you can try using that one by copying it from
<code>support/codeblocks/libmaple.cbp</code> to the top level directory, but no
promises (it might be missing new source files etc). It's probably worth
reading through these instructions as well to get a feel for how it all works. 

<p> 
To create your own "libmaple" project, start with an "Empty Project" with the
"Folder to create project in" set to your libmaple directory. Make sure that
the "Resulting filename" is in the top level directory as well.  

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_newproject.png" > 
</div>

<p>
Select the "GNU GCC Compiler" (it won't be used anyways) and disable the
"Debug" configuration in the next window. Now you should have a project with no
files; add files by right clicking on the project in the left panel file
hierarchy and "Add files recursively". Import both the wirish and libmaple
directories recursively, then add main.cpp separately. 

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_makefile.png" > 
</div>

<p> 
Next we have to configure the Makefile targets. Go to the "Properties..." menu
under "Project" and check the "This is a custom Makefile" box. Then go to the
"Build targets" tab and create "ram" and "flash" targets, both of type "Console
application" and without the Auto-generated filename prefixes or extensions.
Set the Output filename to <code>support/codeblocks/program_flash.sh</code> and
<code>support/codeblocks/program_ram.sh</code> respectively; these scripts just
call the program_ram/program_flash make targets and are a hack to get the "run"
button to upload code to the Maple. The IDE will warn that these files will be
overwritten, but they won't be. For both the "flash" and "ram" targets, click
the "Build options..." button (below "Virtual targets..." etc) and go to the
far right tab ("'Make' commands"). Edit the Clean project/target line so it's
just "clean" (not "clean$target"), and set the "Build project/target" and
"Compile single file" commands to <code>$make -f $makefile
MAPLE_TARGET=$target</code> and <code>$make -f $makefile MAPLE_TARGET=$target
$file</code> respectively.

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_maketargets.png" > 
</div>

<p>
Save all these changes, go back to the main IDE window, and try to build/run.
"Build" will compile everything, "Run" will run the upload script in a terminal
window (if there are problems they will flash by very quickly; you can start
Code::Blocks in a terminal window and check the output in that base window if
necessary), and "Rebuild" will clean before rebuilding. 

<br><br>
<div class="centerimg"> 
<img src="./img/codeblocks_build.png" > 
<br>Success!
</div>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

Further information about our repository structure.  This section is
optional.  Read it only if you're curious about how things work under
the hood.

<p>
Our repository setup is a little unconventional. Usually libraries get
compiled down to a binary archive which other programs link (or pull
from) using hints from source code header files. With that structure
the "library" code and build process is separated from the individual
"program". At this point we frequently end up customizing the
"library" part of the code to suit the "program", so we left it all
mixed together.

<p> 
The <code>main.cpp</code> file in the top directory is often the only "program"
part of the code (of course it could reference arbitrary other source and
header files if it helped break up a larger project). At a minimum it must
declare an <code>int main(void)</code> function; our
<code>main.cpp.example</code> files takes on a structure identical to Arduino
"sketches" with <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code> functions.

<p> 
A second layer of confusion is the separation between the
<code>libmaple/</code> directory and the <code>wirish/</code> directory.  The
<code>libmaple/</code> directory contains our low-level, C-only library for
accessing STM32 hardware peripherals. The <code>wirish/</code> directory
contains C++ code implementing the "Arduino programming language" (called
Wiring); our implementation is not 100% compatible, it's just "Wiring-ish".
When we casually refer to "libmaple" we usually mean both parts together. As
you may imagine, mixing C and C++ code together so close to the metal can get
pretty sticky; if you look through our code there are lots of
<code>#ifdefs</code> and other nonsense to ensure the compiler doesn't throw up
on it.

<p> 
A last, important chunk of libmaple which isn't immediately obvious are the
linker scripts in <code>support/ld/</code> which are essential for actually
building binary files. Hopefully you won't have to modify those unless you're
porting the entire library, through it can be educational to read through the
interrupt jump table. 

<p> 
The <code>Makefile</code> can build and upload to RAM or FLASH; the RAM target
is useful for rapid development because it uploads a little faster and doesn't
burn up FLASH write cycles, but programs in RAM won't persist after a power
cycle and there is significantly less memory available for more elaborate
programs. The target is determined by an environment variable,
<code>MAPLE_TARGET</code>) which defaults to FLASH. It can be modified by
editing the Makefile, specifying in the command (eg, <code>make
MAPLE_TARGET=ram</code>), or with the <code>ram</code> and <code>flash</code>
targets, which modify the environment variable locally.  The <code>make
sketch</code> (or just <code>make</code>) target just builds .bin files;
<code>make install</code> will build and upload the program. If you forget you
can just <code>make help</code>, which dumps a table of targets.  You might
also find the <code>make cscope</code> or <code>make ctags</code> targets
helpful as well if you use those tools.
