<h1>Maple Hardware Errata and Failure Modes</h1>
<p>
This page is a collection of known issues and warnings for each revision of
the Maple board. The failure modes aren't design errors, but are easy ways
to break or damage your board permanently. For a list of differences between
the Maple and Arduinos, see the page on <a
href="compatability.html">compatability</a>.

</ul>

<h2><a name="rev3">Maple Board rev3</a></h2>
<p>This batch of boards went on sale in May 2010. They have a darker red
silkscreen and the "infinity-leaf" logo.
<p>Known design errors:
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:red;">Resistors on D0, D1: </span> these header pins,
  which are RX/TX on USART2 ("Serial2"), have (TODO) Ohm in-line. These 
  resistors increase the immpedence of the lines for ADC reads and affect the
  open drain GPIO functionality of the pins. These resistors were accidentally
  copied over from older Arduino USB designs, where they appear to protect the
  USB-Serial converter from TTL voltage on the headers.

</ul>
<p>Potential failure modes:
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:orange;">TTL voltage on non-tolerant pins: </span> 
  not all header pins are 5v compatible; connecting certain serial devices
  in the wrong way could over voltage the pins.
</ul>
<h2><a name="rev1">Maple Board rev1</a></h2>
<p>
This batch of 100 boards shipped in later 2009. They have a red silkscreen and
the logo is a single pixelated leaf.

<p>Issues:
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:red;">ADC noise: </span> generally very high, in
  particular when the USB port is being used for communications (including
  keep-alive pings when connected to a computer).  This issue was resolved in
  rev3 with a 4-layer design and a geometricaly isolated ADC Vref plane.

  <li><span style="color:red;">Resistors on D0, D1: </span> these header pins,
  which are RX/TX on USART2 ("Serial2"), have (TODO) Ohm in-line. These 
  resistors increase the immpedence of the lines for ADC reads and affect the
  open drain GPIO functionality of the pins. These resistors were accidentally
  copied over from older Arduino USB designs, where they appear to protect the
  USB-Serial converter from TTL voltage on the headers.
