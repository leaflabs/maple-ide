# This script determines the IDE's version, and stores that in
# an output file passed as first argument (or stdout).
#
# It proceeds by reading the top-level file version.txt.  If this file
# contains the string "custom-build", it generates output based on
# today's date and the current HEAD's SHA1.  Otherwise, the contents
# of version.txt are used unaltered.
#
# The IDE reads the content file "lib/build-version.txt" at startup,
# and reacts in some appropriate manner, so the build scripts are
# responsible for putting this script's output there.
#
# Not wonderful, but better than hardcoded strings.
